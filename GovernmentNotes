Government Notes
Flavors of government:

Forms of thought: National, Globalist

Nationalists parties advocate for the following:
Tarriffs on imports
Stronger militaries
less likely to go into alliances
Isolationism in a war unless there are other nationalists
Prefer to annex a territory instead of making it a puppet
more likely to be involved in a war

Globalists parties advocate for the following
Lesser militaries
more likely to go into alliances
will fight for the "good" side in a war, whichever that may be in their eyes
Would prefer to puppet a territory instead of annexing it


Bills that would be on the table
add/remove tariffs on an item (would increase or decrease the price)
purchase/disband a military ship
send aid to a neighbor in a conflict or facing hard times (mission idea?)
go to war
Universal Basic Income (globalists like this, nationalists want the money for other uses)


depending on how far the government is on globalist to nationalist will depend on what bills are passed
