notes

Require fuel to travel to each system
Fuel is measure in tons. it can take between 1 and 3 fuel to go to another system

At each star system you can go to the station.
At the station you can by things


each star system will have between 1 and 10 planets
only 1% of these planets will be habitable
50% of these planets will be gas giants
49% of these planets will be rocky planets
you will start at a habitable planet so there will be atleast one

you can scan the planet to determine if

If the planet is rocky you can send an away team to visit it and scan it

You can influence the

Notes on worlds
Venus Gravity - 8.87, 0.8
Mars - 3.721, 0.1
Mercury 3.7 - 0.05


Moons:
max 12% mass of most planet per moon
max 15% of planetary mass can be moon (ex. planets has 100 mass, max mass of moons is 15 mass)
max moons will be arbitrary
dwarf planets: 5
Rocky planets: 3
Ice Giants: 10
Gas Giants: 15

Options for a revamp of star formation
star starts out with a given number of points.
Ex. Red Dwarves - 55 points
each planet type takes away a certain number of points, eg. rocky planets are 10, etc.
Points can depend on the mass of the star


for a moon id want to start with the density and the mass
I need to find the gravity, radius, and volume
volume = mass / density
radius = cbrt((3 * volume) / (4 * pi))
gravity = GConstant * (mass / (radius ** 2))



formulas that would help
GConstant = 6.6743 * 10**(-8)
radius = cbrt((3 * volume) / (4 * pi))
Volume=(4/3)*π*(radius)^3
mass= density*volume
gravity = GConstant * (mass / (radius ** 2))
