The goal of this is to make a game whereyou can travel to other star systems and trade and stuff.
For whatever reason it got into my head to make it semi-realistic.... and make an annoyingly large file out of it.

Feel free to start with main.py and type the command /help
Current functionality is to generate moons, planets, and galaxies only using the commands

at the very least, so far you can get semi-realistic planet characteristics
(this includes Gravity, Mass, Radius, Density, and volume)
