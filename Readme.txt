The goal of this is to make a game where you can travel to other star systems and trade and stuff.
For whatever reason it got into my head to make it semi-realistic.... and make an annoyingly large file out of it.

Currently most of the "FUN" stuff is being worked on, but the basics are hardened out. Currently it is possible to travel to other stars, visit planets, and view their resources. 
This can be done with both commands or the GUI.

The GUI is a work in progress, and is used in conjuction with the terminal, where results are shared after a button is pressed.
Future goals are to fully remove the need for the terminal (but i may keep it as needed)

A long standing goal for the game is to make it scientifically realistic in galactic generation. This is shown by how planet properties are calculated, using real equations to determine mass gravity, and more.
While this data may not be used in the game anytime soon, I am consistently trying to make it as accurate as it could be.

One example where i have taken creative liberties though is star creation. In real life, Blue Giants have an infentisimally small chance of showing up, but in this program it is raised to 1%
conversely, red dwarfs, which are around 80% of stars, are donwgraded to 60% of stars in this program.

As for planets, there are 5 kind of objects listed as planets, each with accurate masses etc (although the element percentages needs updating). 
These planets are: 
Gas Giants
Ice Giants
Super Earths
Rocky Planets
Dwarf Planets


Also for stars, all Main Sequence Star types are included (eg. A, B, G, etc)

Currently star systems are capped at 8 planets each, and there is not a plan to adjust this anytime soon

Anyhow, hope you enjoy the game! (in the unfinished state it is in)
