The goal of this is to make a game whereyou can travel to other star systems and trade and stuff.
For whatever reason it got into my head to make it semi-realistic.... and make an annoyingly large file out of it.

Anything that is on the top of the document and is seperated by dashes or /\ /\ /\ or \/\/\/
may be edited. It is suggested that if you edit main.py and you edit the number of systems, that the 
number of overflow systems is half of the number of systems.

System links are randomly assigned and cannot be assumed to actually be near eachother

Current work is being made to have planets and moons and stars have realistic qualities
eg. mass a tenth of earth but twice the gravity for planets and moons
stars will eventually be divided into types (currently they have no qualities)
